# Sentiment-Analysis-for-German-Drama
This project has applied BoW model to develop a speech level sentiment classifier (multi-class) to perform sentiment analysis for a German drama Emilia Galotti.

The sentiments used for analysis are positive, negative and neutral. The corresponding annotation guidelines and the project report are uploaded as .pdf files. The .csv file is the training/test data and the classifier is applied on the whole drama (see https://textgridrep.org/browse/-/browse/rksr_0). In the .ipynb file, the developing process and the sentiment analysis process are demonstrated.
