# Sentiment-Analysis-for-German-Drama
This (student) project has applied BoW model to develop a speech level sentiment classifier (multi-class) to perform sentiment analysis for a German drama Emilia Galotti.

The sentiments used for analysis are positive, negative and neutral, although in the original annotation file (Dataset_Emilia_Galotti_Final_withMix.csv), the mixed sentiment (TAG: mix) is also incorporated. The corresponding annotation guidelines and the project report are uploaded as .pdf files. The Dataset_Emilia_Galotti_Final_noMix.csv file is the training/test data. In the .ipynb file, the developing process and the sentiment analysis process are demonstrated (The classifier is applied on the drama: https://textgridrep.org/browse/-/browse/rksr_0).
